### Translations
Heya! here is some information about how you can make a translation or modify an existing translation!

I also want to thank everyone who made a translation for this mod! This makes the mod more accessible for everyone.

Things to know:
- The "%number%" are placeholders, The number indicates what it needs to be replaced with.
- funny things are allowed, as long as they don't make the mod less accessible or cluttered!
