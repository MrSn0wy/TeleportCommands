### Translations
Heya! here is some information about how you can make a translation or modify an existing translation!

I also want to thank everyone who made a translation for this mod! This makes the mod more accessible for everyone.

Things to know:
- The "%number%" are placeholders, The number indicates what it needs to be replaced with. (For example `Tpa%0%` will become `TpaHere` or `Tpa`, this allows the translations to be more flexible)
- funny things are allowed, as long as they don't make the mod less accessible or cluttered!

#### Want to make a translation?
1. Make a fork of the mod ([Guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository))
2. Go [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language) and pick the in-game locale code for the language you want to translate. (for example: `en_us`)
3. Copy `en_us.json` and paste it in a new file called `[in-game locale code here].json` (in the same directory!)
4. Translate the values in the file (`"commands.teleport_commands.XX.XX": "Translate this!",`)
5. Submit a pull request with your translation :D! ([Guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request))
